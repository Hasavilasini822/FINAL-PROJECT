    * Provide balanced and adequate nutrients through regular fertilization
    * Maintain consistent and proper watering practices to prevent both overwatering and underwatering.
    * Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the coconut tree to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature.
    * Install temporary windbreaks or barriers to shield the coconut tree from strong winds.''',

    'Bud Rot': '''
    CULTURAL CONTROL:
    * Provide adequate drainage in gardens.
    * Adopt Proper spacing and avoid overcrowding in bud rot-prone gardens.

    CHEMICAL CONTROL:
    * Remove all the infected tissues of the crown region and clean it with water. After that, apply Bordeaux paste to the center of the crown.
      {Bordeaux paste -[100g copper sulfate with 100g quick lime] each dissolved in 500 ml water} careful to handle
    * Application of Talc formulation of P.Fluorscens
    * Spraying of liquid formulation of P.Fluorescens.
    * Spraying the palms with Metalaxyl 35EC @ 2g/lt of water.
    * Spraying the palms with Dimenthomorph @ 1g/lt of water.''',

    'Caterpillars': '''
    CULTURAL CONTROL:
    * As a prophylactic measure, the first affected leaves may be cut and burnt during the beginning of the summer season.

    CHEMICAL CONTROL:
    * If the attack is severe, spray the undersurface of the leaves with 0.02% dichlorous, malathion 50 EC 0.05%, quinalphos 0.05%, Phosalone 0.05%
    * Biological control is very effective through the release of parasitoids like Gorriozus nephantidis, Elasmus, and Brachimeria Nosatoi
    * Soluneem the first water-soluble non-toxic neem pesticide.''',

    'Stem Bleeding': '''
    CULTURAL CONTROL:
    * Avoid contact of wounded palm stems with soil.
    * We ask you to remove dead trees completely and do not plant the seedlings again in that pit
    * Destroy the chiseled materials by burning
    * Provide adequate irrigation during summer and drainage during the rainy season along with recommended fertilizer.
    * Along with 50kg FYM, apply 5kg neem cake containing the antagonistic fungi, Trichoderma.

    CHEMICAL CONTROL:
    * Chisel out completely the affected tissues and paint the wound with tridemorph 5% or Bordeaux paste.
      Apply coal tar after 1-2 days on the treated portion. Burn off chiseled pieces.
    * Root feed with Tridemorph 5ml in 100 ml water, thrice a year during April-May, 
      September-October, and January-February to prevent further spread of lesions.''',

    'Flaccidity': '''
    CULTURAL METHODS:
    * Cut and remove disease leaves from the trees.
    * Irrigate coconut palms with at least 250 liters of water in a week.
    * Provide adequate drainage facilities.
    
    BIOLOGICAL METHODS:
    * Apply 50 kg FYM or green manure and 5 kg of neem cake / palm / year.

    CHEMICAL METHODS:
    * Apply fertilizers for coconut palms in average management at the rate of 1.3 kg urea, 2.00 kg super phosphate and 3.5 kg potash (MOP) / palm / year
     in the form of urea, rock phosphate and muriate of potash, respectively.
    * Magnesium may be supplied @ 500 g MgO per palm per year.''',

    'Yellowing': '''
    CULTURAL METHODS:
    * Provide adequate warm and light.
    * Mist the plant with water from a spray bottle every day. 

    CHEMICAL CONTROL:
    * Apply a foliar spray of 2% of urea thrice at fortnightly intervals or soil application of 1 to 2 kg of urea per tree or 1% of urea twice a year.''',
